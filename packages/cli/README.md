# @opace/content-integrity-cli

![Opace AI Content Integrity evidence workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpaceDigitalAgency/opace-ai-content-verification-integrity-checker/main/docs/assets/opace-ai-content-integrity-hero-v2.png)

Node CLI for offline Opace AI Content Integrity inspection, protected-span checks, comparison and hash-only receipt operations.

`opace-integrity --format json inspect -` reads UTF-8 stdin and writes machine output without banners or progress. `--offline` asserts the zero-network path; `--quiet` suppresses text-mode output. Unsupported configuration/cache options and held commands fail explicitly rather than being silently ignored. Models, provider calls, public watermark fixtures and content-bearing receipt storage remain unavailable.

MIT licensed.

Requires Node.js 20 or newer. The package installs the `opace-integrity` executable and uses the same frozen contract and deterministic core as the browser surfaces.

> Release state: a 0.1.0 npm candidate is prepared locally but is not published. The install command below applies only after owner-approved publication.

## Install

```sh
npm install --global @opace/content-integrity-cli
```

## Commands

```sh
opace-integrity inspect article.txt
opace-integrity inspect - --format json < article.txt
opace-integrity protect extract article.txt --format json
opace-integrity receipt verify receipt.json --format json
```

Use JSON mode for automation. Standard output contains only the requested machine result; diagnostics go to standard error. Hash-only receipts exclude the input text. The CLI never converts an unsupported or unavailable check into a passing result.

## Privacy and limits

Offline commands do not require the loopback service. Service-backed commands accept only the frozen loopback origin and runtime token handling; no cloud endpoint or provider fallback exists. Do not pass confidential text on a shared command line where shell history or process inspection may expose it; prefer standard input.

## Verify and support

```sh
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run pack:check
```

Models, comparative detector claims and content-bearing storage remain outside this package boundary.

## Troubleshooting and links

- **Machine output contains unexpected text:** use `--format json`; normal results go to standard output and diagnostics to standard error.
- **A held option fails:** `--config`, `--cache-dir` and unavailable model commands are intentionally rejected rather than ignored.
- **Sensitive text appears in process arguments:** pipe it through standard input instead of placing it on the command line.

## Attribution

This engine was built on existing open-source work by deliberate choice, so the projects it

## Where this is weakest, measured

This package ships the deterministic character forensics and editorial writing rules. It does
**not** contain the trained model that produces an AI reading; Cycle 5 runs only in the web
checker. The model results are disclosed here so package users can distinguish the two systems.

**The writing rules are editorial feedback, not detection.** On 922 machine and 1,200 held-out
human long-form documents, they detect 45.1% of machine writing while flagging **24.8% of human
writing** — one human document in four. `computeEditorialSignals` returns a writing score, never
an authorship reading, and must not be presented as one.

The deployed Cycle 5 model (`tier3-cycle5-v1`, margin rule
`max(m1, m2+0.34) >= 3.571`) was measured separately through both live runtimes on the full
5,558-document long-form evaluation corpus. That corpus is not wholly independent: 654/922 AI
documents are independent of every Cycle 2 split and 268 are not; 11/4,636 human documents
overlap. The separate topic-matched held-out slice is the independent evasion measurement.

| Cycle 5 measurement | result | denominator and runtime |
|---|---:|---|
| AI documents flagged | **97.8%** | 902/922, EU server fp32 |
| human documents wrongly flagged | **0.99%** | 46/4,636, EU server fp32 |
| AI documents flagged | **97.6%** | 900/922, browser int8 |
| human documents wrongly flagged | **1.57%** | 73/4,636, browser int8 |
| topic-matched held-out AI flagged | **86.9%** | 153/176, server evaluation route |
| structured human partners wrongly flagged | **0.2%** | 1/418, server evaluation route |
| human fiction wrongly flagged | **3.1% / 3.5%** | 7/227 server / 8/227 browser |
| held-out 100-word AI flagged | **76.8%** | 43/56, server evaluation route |
| heavy AI edits of human originals flagged | **28.5%** | 39/137, server evaluation view |
| academic human documents wrongly flagged | **0.8%** | 15/1,992, server evaluation view |

The 100-word cell is small, fiction remains higher-risk than the overall human set, and treating
heavy AI edits as machine-assisted is a product boundary rather than proof of authorship. Do not
use a result for an academic misconduct decision about one student.

*Historical, not current:* Cycle 2 (`tier3-cycle2-v1`, live 28 August – 1 September 2026) produced
the earlier 883/922 server, 889/922 browser, 45/4,636 server-human and 90/4,636 browser-human
figures. Its fiction and length rows are retired and must not be mixed with Cycle 5.
